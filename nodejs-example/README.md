# Access RabbitMQ with node.js

This example contains several publisher and consumer clients that exchange random messages every few seconds. The transfer is purely done via RabbitMQ interface. The code for the clients is based on the [publish/subscribe tutorial](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-javascript.html) on the RabbitMQ website.

```shell
docker-compose up
```
